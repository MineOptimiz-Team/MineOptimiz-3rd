# FastQuit Config
version:1.2.2+1.18.2

## Determines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving
showToasts:true

## When playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.
## By enabling this setting the 'Saving world' screen will be rendered.
renderSavingScreen:false

## Sets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background
## This is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all
## Value has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority
backgroundPriority:2
